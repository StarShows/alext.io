# Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. It consists of a main page created with vanilla JavaScript, SCSS, and HTML. Additionally, there is a subdirectory called "Portfolio - React," which houses a new React project I'm developing to practice and showcase my ReactJS skills.

This portfolio includes a variety of algorithms, scripts, projects, and apps created by Alex Tannenbaum.
